                Bembi's Kitchen is a backyard resto/cafe that opened on July
                2014 in Magalang, Pampanga. Considered a hidden gem, Bembi's
                menu expanded from offering pizzas to serving other comfort food
                like wings, pastas, burgers, milkshakes, lemongrass teas, coffee
                and now even has wine and cheese platters. With a strong
                dedication to quality, we only choose the freshest ingredients
                (some from our own garden), and make everything from scratch.
                This is just one of the reasons why Bembi's is being sought by
                different foodies outside the town and has been rated excellent
                on numerous occasions. Our mission is to satisfy not just the
                appetites, but all the senses as well. We want to give you an
                experience with every bite that would stay in a special place in
                your heart.
