        <h2 class="history-heading2">Municipality of Magalang</h2> 
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h2 class="history-heading">HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="history-paragraph">
          Magalang is one of the most ancient towns of Pampanga, established by
          the Augustinians in 1605 at the western side of majestic Mount Arayat,
          under the governorship of Pedro Bravo de Acuña. Its original site was
          a place called Macapsa, which was later transferred to San Bartolome.
          As early as 1660, Magalang was only one of 15 towns in the province to
          have an Augustinian church and convent to administer to the spiritual
          needs of the residents. Its first prior was Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar.
          <br /><br />
          Early in its history, Magalang figured in some of the most tumultuous
          moments in the Kapampangan region. The armed rebellions of Francisco
          Maniago and that of the Pangasinense rebel Andres Malong, wrought
          havoc on the town in 1660 and 1734 respectively, causing the dispersal
          of the townfolks to various locations. There was also the great flood
          caused by the Parua River in May 1863 which necessitated the
          relocation of the town center.
          <br /><br />
          First to move was the gobernadorcillo Pablo Luciano, who, together
          with his followers like the Cortezes and Davids, moved from San
          Bartolome to Barrio San Pedro or Talimundoc which became the
          new‘poblacion’. The group brought with them the image of their patron,
          San Bartolome. Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia helepd in the transfer and gave
          the town its name, San Pedro de Magalang. Meanwhile, another group of
          families led by the Aquinos, Yumuls and Pinedas transferred to Barrio
          Matandoc, which they put under the advocation of the Immaculate
          Conception. Magalang expanded with the generous land donation of Don
          Cristobal Lacson, which included that occupied by the church of
          Magalang and the now-abandoned old municipal cemetery.
          <br /><br />
          During the Philippine Revolution, Magalang was the site of the battle
          of Camansi that led to the annihilation of General Monet’s army by
          local revolucionarios that included Carlos Guiao and Candido Niceta.
          Under the American Regime, Magalang became a prosperous sugar and rice
          town. The Pampanga Agricultural College, established during the
          Spanish times at the foothills of Arayat, was revitalized and
          continues to be a highly regarded institution of agricultural learning
          to this day. The town’s society life flourished with the influx of
          wealth and several social clubs like Mountainside, were organized in
          the 1930s.
          <br /><br />
          Today, Magalang has kept its old world charm amidst 21st-century
          progress. Heritage houses line many of its streets. It continues to be
          famous for its sweet confections; the favorite pastillas de leche from
          this town are renowned for their unsurpassed creaminess made more
          delectable by carabao’s milk. Many inland fishponds, piggeries, and
          poultry farms were moved to Magalang by small entrepreneurs following
          the Pinatubo eruption, infusing the town with much-needed income and
          reinvigorating these small industries. Magalang may be ancient in age,
          but it has a youthful, can-do attitude in its pursuit of its goals, a
          forward-looking vision that continues to yield gains for its 27
          barangays and their residents. For that, Magalang has certainly earned
          our respect.

        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="history-heading">POLITICAL SUBDIVISION</h2>
        <p class="history-paragraph">
          Magalang is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.
          <br />
          Camias, Dolores, Escaler, La Paz, Navaling, San Agustin, San Antonio,
          San Francisco, San Ildefonso, San Isidro, San Jose, San Miguel, San
          Nicolas Uno (Pob.), San Nicolas Dos, San Pablo, San Pedro Uno (Pob.),
          San Pedro Dos, San Roque, San Vicente, Santa Cruz (Pob.), Santa Lucia,

        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h2 class="history-heading">LOCAL GOVERNMENT</h2>
        <p class="history-paragraph">
          Like other towns in the Philippines, Magalang is governed by a mayor
          and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the
          executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the
          Sangguniang Bayan's ordinances and improving public services. The vice
          mayor heads a legislative council consisting of councilors, as
          members. Lyndon Cunanan was elected mayor in May 2007. However, his
          win was disputed by businessman Romulo Pecson because of election
          fraud. Pecson won a Supreme Court order in 2009, that forced Cunanan
          to vacate his post. Pecson then sat as municipal mayor and was
          re-elected in 2010. Former Mayor Lyndon Cunanan and his former Vice
          Mayor Norman Lacson have filed their certificates of candidacy for
          mayor and vice mayor, respectively, to contest in the next municipal
          elections in 2013.

        <h2 class="history-heading">SCHOOL</h2>
        <p class="history-paragraph">
          Pampanga Agricultural College <br />
          Strategically nestled among the foothills on the western slope of
          majestic Mt. Arayat, Pampanga Agricultural College (PAC) occupies
          nearly 700 hectares of government agricultural lands in the town of
          Magalang, province of Pampanga. The campus is about 3.5 km east of the
          town proper of Magalang, and about 15 km due southwest is Angeles City
          and Clark Field Special Economic Zone. Farther southeast about 25 km
          lies the City of San Fernando, the capital of Pampanga.<br /><br />
          Established more than a century ago (1885), this state agricultural
          institution stands among the other public and private academic
          institutions in the province and in Central Luzon. The College, with
          its focus on Instruction, R&D, Extension-Training and Production,
          envisions itself to be a center of excellence for development in
          agriculture, science and industrial technology, and comprehensive
          education and training for global competitiveness.<br /><br />
          Likewise, PAC continuously undertakes agricultural research,
          production and extension-training activities aimed at enhancing the
          quality of higher education and countryside development. Equally vital
          is the promotion of excellence in education and its products for
          improved agricultural and rural development in Pampanga as well as for
          the entire region.<br /><br />
          Principally established as an agricultural school, PAC became a state
          college in September 1974, and 30 years later, the College offers a
          total of 13 undergraduate courses (both allied and non-allied
          courses), 2-year computer courses, a two-year course in agricultural
          technology, maintains a laboratory high school, an agricultural
          science high school, and operates a graduate school for three masteral
          and three doctoral degrees.<br /><br />
          PAC has been richly endowed with both physical and human resources,
          and has utilized external linkages and collaborations as vital support
          system to pursue its academic mandate. Through the years, the College
          has produced 30 Ph.D’s among its faculty line-up, 100 masteral degree
          holders and 65 bachelor degree holders, and supported by an
          administrative staff of 152 personnel.<br /><br />
          In terms of physical facilities, the College has a state of the art
          Audio-Visual Center, sports facilities, a Vet Med hospital, in-campus
          dormitories, FM radio station, Farmers’ Training Center,
          Tissue-culture and Feed laboratories, Internet Café, campus-based
          computer network and PAC website; these and many more.<br /><br />
          External support systems are equally important and PAC has established
          considerable number of linkages with renown institutions - both local
          and international. Among the numerous institutions include: PhilRice,
          UP, CHED, NEDA, Philippine Carabao Center, PCARRD, CLSU, SEARCA, DAR,
          DOST, DAP, DA and DBP. Linkages with non-government organizations
          include: ALMARAI Dairy Company (Saudi Arabia), FORD Foundation,
          East-West Phils., USETECH Corporation and Good Earth Technology
          International, Inc., among others.<br /><br />
          The College, likewise has existing exchange programs with
          international universities in South Korea (Hannam University, Pai Chai
          Univeristy, Andong National University), in the United States (Purdue
          University; Iowa State University) and in China (Shenzhen Business
          College). The College has existing partnership with ICRISAT in India
          in terms of R&D activities aimed at enhancing agricultural development
          in rainfed cropping areas.<br /><br />
          The College will sustain pursuing for universityhood, a dream that has
          been long delayed and stalled over the years. Even then, PAC takes
          pride in its humble achievements made possible through joint efforts
          exerted by those caring and sharing people in and around the PAC
          Community – both the benefactors and the beneficiaries.
